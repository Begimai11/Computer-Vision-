# Computer-Vision-
In-Car Sleepiness Detection System
The project involves interaction between the user (the driver) 
and the computer (the system). The interaction occurs through the input from the webcam (capturing the driver's face and eyes) and the output in the form of an auditory alarm when drowsiness is detected. 
- The auditory alarm functions as a way to communicate with the driver, alerting him to the presence of detected drowsiness

The driver's reaction to the auditory alarm completes the feedback-response process. Upon receiving the feedback, the driver is expected to take appropriate measures, such as awakening, adjusting their position, or pausing driving.
- Requirement libraries: OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, Pygame
